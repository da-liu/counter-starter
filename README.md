This is a starter pack for a React counter app. It is meant to a practice assignment for someone learning the basics of React. It contains a set of tests that checks for the main functionalities of the app:

1. A span with the id `count` that displays an initial count of 3
2. Three buttons with the class `increment` that increase the count value.
3. The buttons each have distinct ids:

  i. Button with id `#increment1` should increase count by 1 for each click

  ii. Button with id `#increment5` should increase count by 5 for each click

  iii. Button with id `#increment10` should increase count by 10 for each click

To begin:

1. clone the app to the local drive: `git clone https://github.com/da-liu/counter-starter.git`
2. install dependencies: `cd counter-starter && npm install`
3. start app `npm start` in one terminal, and watch for test in another terminal `npm test`
4. edit `App.js` to build the required features and pass all the tests
5. submit your app to [TODO: email or slack channel](http://example.com) to get an example solution
